Hi everybody! In this folder, you'll find materials supporting my vid, **Multiple regression in R: example**, which you can find at <https://youtu.be/_NS-SMi21mA>. 

The `parenthood` data set comes from Danielle Navarro's excellent book, *Learning Statistics with R*, linked [here](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/).
